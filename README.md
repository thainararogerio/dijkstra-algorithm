# dijkstra-algorithm
A Java implementation of the __Dijkstra Algorithm__: an algorithm used to find the minimum path between any two vertices in a graph.   

It is part of my research for my graduation final project, which consists of adding a __Shortest Path Intelligence__ to a __Traffic Simulator__.
